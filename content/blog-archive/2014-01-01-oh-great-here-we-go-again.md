Now California is acting on mother fucking Proposition 65 from fucking 1986, to stop vendors from selling foods which contain dangerous levels of lead without a warning that they don&#8217;t need in the other 49 states.<!-- more -->   Now none of the mail order catalogues want to sell us any licorice, ginger root, or any of dozens of other delicious foods.

I don&#8217;t know about the rest of California, but I want my delicious poison, and I don&#8217;t care how many years it takes off my life span. You only live once anyway.
