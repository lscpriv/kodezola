It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve come full circle or something. And I even kept all the old content, including all the crap I banged into the original WordPress blag I had running on AWS hosting, later moved to Google Compute, then on again.

Now it&#8217;s still on DigitalOcean. They&#8217;ve got great hosting, man.
