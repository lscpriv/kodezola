Seriously, fuck that shit. <!-- more -->  And fuck CBS, too. Also copyrights. Fuck them, too. If you don&#8217;t want someone to copy your ideas, don&#8217;t share them with anyone. And certainly don&#8217;t have delusions that you could make a living off your ideas. Better to get paid minimum wage flipping burgers, or better still, prove that your dislike of making money is a disability and live off the dole instead.

Here, have a video I tried to upload to YouTube as unlisted, but they took my unlisted privilege away because I stole some advertisement revenue away from CBS.

<video controls preload="auto" playsinline data-setup='{"fluid": true}' width="640" height="360"> <source src="//balde.losno.co/v/poor_nitro.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> </video>
