CSS finished replacing the display assembly in my iMac. The report indicated &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of stuck pixels, so I guess I got lucky with the warranty.

My dad figures maybe one in ten people who experience this problem actually have it dealt with, while the rest either put up with it and don&#8217;t bother to take it into the shop, or don&#8217;t even notice it.
