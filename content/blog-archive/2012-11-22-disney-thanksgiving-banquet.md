I ate like a pig. Then I had the screaming shits. Twice. Then I barfed my guts out. Then I had the screaming shits again. My gut still hasn&#8217;t settled, either.

EDIT: I just threw up again.

EDIT: More screaming shits and vomiting in alternating waves. Food poisoning sucks.

EDIT: More and more of that, and I went to the hospital. It wasn&#8217;t Disney&#8217;s food. It was only their fault in that they were a huge mass of people who could pass this virus on to other people, but it only spreads orally or rectally, not airborne, and not a result of contaminated food. The hospital did say they treated four people before me for the same thing, and that was just UCI Medical Center.
