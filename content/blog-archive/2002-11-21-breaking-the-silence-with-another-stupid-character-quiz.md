Off in daily activity land, I have been showing off how I don't have a life by trolling at a message board I actually serve as an administrator at. How useful. Of course, I'm not the only person to troll under other account names, and I'm usually the first to know who it was that was trolling under another account. I also seem to be a master, as nobody has picked up on it. Probably a good thing, as they would come to realize that a complete nut has total control over their forum database.
