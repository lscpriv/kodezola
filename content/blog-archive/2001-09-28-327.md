Whoah, weird sleep cycle, with some equally weird dreams &#8230;

Parts of it were like the first person shooter I was playing briefly last night, leveled skills that increase with time, scope weapons &#8230;

At one point, I was downtown in my local city, and looking for a way home, and I even bumped into my family, who was downtown at the time&#8230; they pointed me not to go through this one neighborhood, as it was new or something.

Later, I'm witnessing (and probably guarding) this ceremony involving some leader who looked very much like Castro deploying some remotely controllable missile platform for the UN or something weird&#8230; and someone tampered with it and fired missiles before it was deployed. They even launched the observation units (some remote controlled vehicles with camera equipment for monitoring .. whatever) at a US Naval ship or whoever owned the large carrier ship &#8230; said leader Castro or whoever looked rather astonished.

Then I woke up &#8230; ah well, time for dinner. Later, kiddies.
