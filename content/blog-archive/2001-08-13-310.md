Grr&#8230;.

I pulled a really crappy all-nighter this time.

After staying up all night, I had a bowl of cereal at 5:30am. I then had lunch at 12:40p, which consisted of a meat/cheese/lettuce sandwich, french onion sun chips, and 24oz of COKE. About 20 minutes later, I flopped down on my bed and slept for about 7 hours xX
