wh00&#8230;. had my first session with the psychologist today.. he thinks my long hours at the computer are my way of coping with depression

he has prescribed scheduling certain limited times at the computer, at least 2 attempts per week to find a job, and for me to write my resume&eacute; which he even offered to look over&#8230;.

bleh

I enjoy writing and posting and crap, but I do suppose it really is some form of coping with depression&#8230; hell, even my physician put me on an anti-depressant, which has shown noticeable improvement&#8230; i used to be one moody sonovagun ðŸ˜›

ah well, so continues my life

oh, did i mention i stayed up till 5:15am and my mom woke me at 8:15am for this appointment? ick&#8230;
