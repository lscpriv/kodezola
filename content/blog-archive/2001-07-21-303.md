Bleh, gettin bitched at by the parents because I'm spewing my perverted crap at them, like the stuff I read all over the internet, and continuing to discuss the junk my brother wrote in his sk00l assigned journal; topics like if he were locked in a wal-mart overnight (he'd rob them blind) and freestyle (boobytrap the empire state building, with a special trap in the top floor that only a VIP enters that will trigger explosives to collapse the building, but said VIP wont arrive until sufficient time has passed to allow the other traps to go off &#8230;. my brother is a deviant all right, just like me ðŸ˜› ) etc&#8230;

Is it so old-fashioned to not want to fill one's mind with filth, or is it the trend these days to absorb and discuss every little bit of filth one can get their hands on&#8230;.

Oh, and they're also bitching because I stay up all night and sleep most of the day&#8230; so I'm now forced to live a more 'normal' schedule of sleeping when they do. Not so bad really, I just have to stop what I'm doing sooner, but then I get to resume at an earlier time as I wake sooner ðŸ™‚
