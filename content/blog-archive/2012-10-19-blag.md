So I set up this little place on the Internets, and it only cost me a little bit of my money for an AWS account and a domain. Go me.

Then I moved my IRC client over to it, including its nearly 3 years of mostly uninterrupted backlog, complete with search interface. Again, go me.

Then I took some friends&#8217; advice and replaced Apache with nginx, and got various scripts working with it. Yes, go me.

Finally, I got around to installing WordPress, so I can blag like there&#8217;s no tomorrow, without dealing with silly sites that existed before the Web 2.0 boom. Yay.

Now get off my lawn.
