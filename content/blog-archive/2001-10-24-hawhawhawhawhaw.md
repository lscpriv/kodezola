**I AM 27% GEEK.**

[<img border="0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.fuali.com/Online_Tests/geek/images/geek-prom.gif?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

I probably work in computers, or a history
  
deptartment at a college. I never really
  
fit in with the "normal" crowd. But I have
  
friends, and this is a good thing.

**I AM 22% GOTH.**

[<img border="0" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.fuali.com/Online_Tests/goth/images/slave.gif?w=840" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

Goth by night, normal by day. Deep in my
  
heart I know I am evil, but not on the
  
company's time. I do need to eat.
