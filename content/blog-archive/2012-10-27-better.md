Equipping a back brace helped significantly, and some ibuprofin probably helped as well. I&#8217;ll be removing the brace in a few minutes and then I&#8217;ll head off into dream land.

Good news, maybe I&#8217;ll install Visual Studio tomorrow and start working on some of my projects, or even something new. Who knows?
