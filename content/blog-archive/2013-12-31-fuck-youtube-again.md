This is getting to become a trend now. I&#8217;m not even allowed to upload a <s>20</s> 53 second clip of a movie to make a humorous point without stumbling across copyright blocks. <!-- more -->  Fuck that noise, they can send me DMCA notices directly if they give two shits about it.

So this is the clip:<video controls preload="auto" playsinline data-setup='{"fluid": true}' width="640" height="360"> <source src="//balde.losno.co/v/Youre-sick.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> </video> 

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">I equate Tails82&#8217;s typical shitposting behavior to Marv stuffing the drains in the sinks and leaving the water running, as seen in Home Alone. He&#8217;s sick, alright.</span>
