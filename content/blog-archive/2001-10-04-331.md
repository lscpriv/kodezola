yippie fuck, I get to go to a fucking group workshop shit at the local county mental health care facility, aren't I a lucky SOB&#8230;

Yeah, people think I need help just because I'm 19 and would rather sit on my ass in front of my computer all day instead of tearing off of it for 8 hours a day to become a fricking automaton. Just because I need the money does not mean I will work for it. Oh, and the fact that I never go out to &#8230; do who the fuck knows with who goddamn knows who &#8230; perhaps I should go outside and find the nearest street gang and spend a few hours a day leaning against a wall and looking menacing, or swearing pointlessly, or perhaps smoking a bowl. Yay. Then at least I'd be "socializing" with my "peers."
