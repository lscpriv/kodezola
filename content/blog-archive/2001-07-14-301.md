w00t or smth&#8230; got up at 3:46pm, microwaved some leftover domino's pizza for lunch..

helped my dad mess with some electrical stuff&#8230; he managed to find some broken breakers while finding the one that turned off the fixture he was going to replace. ended up replacing the wrong one (and as he said, he will admit it "NEVAAARR!!!!~~") because the one he took out had a broken indicator. stupid pushmatic breakers (push on/push off) &#8230; oh well, everything works now

on a side note, found a little green frog in our back yard ^_^
