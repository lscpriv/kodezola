Ah, good ol' chain IM's ðŸ™‚

Almost as good as an hour long IRC channel flood fest. If you have logging on, those are always good for adding a few MB's to your log collection ;-P

Oh yeah, and I passed one of these on to [pinkchan][1] and she told me to go fuck myself with the snowball. Although it doesn't really matter anyway, since I know she hates chain messages, but I did it anyway because I thought it was funny as hell, and I don't really give a rat's ass what she thinks ;-P
