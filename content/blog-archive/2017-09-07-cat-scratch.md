So, I was just getting up around noon today, and headed into the living room, where I found our male kitty, Gibbs, and he was in a good mood. So I sat down, in my t-shirt and underwear, cross-legged, and he sat in my lap for a whole of 30 seconds, kneading around and purring happily, until I accidentally swung my arm to the left into a trash can, which scared the shit out of him and made him bound out of my lap, leaving this nice souvenir.
