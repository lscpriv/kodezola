Wow, I keep seeing all kinds of shit flying each and every way all over LJ &#8230;. such arrogance over friendships. Guilt and hate by association really sucks, people. Are we really this petty and spiteful?

Please feel free to reply as this, like all my previous entries, is open to public replies. And if anyone cares, I have not made any private or friends-only entries yet&#8230; as if I care who reads what I post here.
