Upon pink's suggestion, c/p'd to my LJ.

    <strong>Wow, Zephlic, I thought you were just a tad rude before&#8230;</strong>
  </p>

  but after reading your LJ, I see you are quite the arrogant bastard. Good for you that you only share your pathetic life with your snot-nosed friends. Not like I would want to read that shit anyway, but did you know not everyone checks their profile every day to see who has vanished from their Friends-of list, and I know I am not speaking for my own profile, but all I see is asshole written all over your journal. Yes, I know it is YOUR JOURNAL, but you seem to radiate that beyond your journal.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Please do not make me a part of your clique. You clearly have a way with people, judging by how well you can bitch people out in your few public posts, and I heard you may have become an admin, with little or no qualifications other than you are really good at flaming people out.

    OOH OOH!! PINK IS AN EVIL BITCH AND SHE NEEDS TO DIE! CAMMI, GO TO HELL, EVIL WOMAN! KABLOOIE AND HABBY, EAT SHIT AND GO SCREW YOURSELVES!!!!
  </p>

    There, can I be an admin now too? Huh?

Oh, and a slight amendment&#8230;. For some damn reason, I actually want to read some of your entries, out of morbid curiosity o.O
