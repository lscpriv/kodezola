I went to the dentist for my twice yearly checkup again, and this time, I had a popped filling, possibly one from my previous dentist from over 10 years ago. And after the checkup, and the report of watching the same teeth as last time, no new full cavities, but I do have to wait over a month until I can go back in and get this missing filling taken care of. Oh, and a chipped tooth as well, joy!
