Yeah, wow, I haven't used this thing since 2004. Nope, you're not getting those old posts back, that's all crazy talk. Archived forever, though, just the way I like.

Just to clear some minor points that may be confused by Google searching, that guy on eBay isn't me. Neither is that guy on Skype without the zero in his name.

Oh, and I had this name on LiveJournal long before some person registered it at the Awful Forums, then later changed it to something else. I didn't register there until years later, and I'm kode54, nothing else.

Maybe watch this space, maybe not. I'm sure Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub are much more convenient ways of tracking my activities than this old piece of crap.
