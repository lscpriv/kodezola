Some lady called me three times from Triplett Travel in Moreno Valley, CA, once I accidentally picked up, and twice she left voice messages. She thinks I&#8217;m a cab company and she wants me to make sure there&#8217;s a cab to pick her up at the travel agency at 4AM tomorrow. I hope she&#8217;s not too terribly disappointed that she&#8217;s not going to have a &#8220;cayub&#8221; there tomorrow. I did kind of want to drop her an e-mail to let her know that she got the wrong number, since that would be clearer than calling her from my cell, but since her company has no web site or e-mail contact information, I won&#8217;t bother.
