And soon I shall vanish from the Internet again, I assume. One is required to live a "normal" life that involves sleeping by night, and being available to do odd chores by day.

Ah, fuck it. I will stay up all night and sleep all day and make myself generally useless to my parents if I Goddamn well please. If they don't like it, they should have thrown me out when I turned 18 ;-P
