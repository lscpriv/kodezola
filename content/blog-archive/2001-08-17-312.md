Well, fiery, as per your request about the aurorium ðŸ˜›

Pink changed the icons to kitty toast, and people threw a fit ðŸ˜›

Even Geno had something against it so I heard &#8230; bleh, so she quit, then Cammi quit too, and they got together and made a wacked out MOTD&#8230; Cammi reduced Geno to a regular user, and pink demoted all the other admins to mod to prevent them from restoring Geno, and then pink/cammi de-admin'd themselves. She left Luna as an admin because she wants Luna to have to see it firsthand and fix it/question pink herself instead of hearing it through Geno or another middle player. Please read her LJ first before jumping to too many conclusions XP

Oh, and I believe she could have removed Luna's admin position on the board if she felt like it, or is there some feature I do not know about that protects the creator of the board from being stripped of their admin flags?

OH, and before I forget. **They aren't gone.** They just quit as admins because they are tired of people's shit. Luna can return and restore LeninGeno to his position of power and all will be right in the land of Geno's Neo<font color="red">*</font>Yoshi<font color="red">*</font>Aurorium
