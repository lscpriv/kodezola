Yay, I was overclocking my machine without sufficient cooling, and it waits until hot weather to become unstable&#8230; that, or it just gradually fused something &#8230; wtf. Anyway, it was really hot, and now that I'm back at my old default settings, it's benchmarking slower than it was when I originally ran it at spec. Joy, I guess I damaged something.
