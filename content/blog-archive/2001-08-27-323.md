Meant to post this this morning, but LJ was down most of the day&#8230; posted to intended time&#8230; Anyway, here goes:

  lets type the fun you can have during and after a run of 17 hours of sleep!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  (going to sleep around 3pm on sunday and waking at about 7:45am monday)
</p>

<p align="justify">
  dreams with weird stuff&#8230; some i forget now, others like some bizarre comic i "read" in the dream, like some jumpstart based thing &#8230;.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  first panel was like one of the kids facing away, with what looks like some older woman's head captioned like "i was born with my mother's head" and a panel or so along, her facing readers, with longer neck and with a head more her age, but still weird looking "but then I bought megaman's head!" (WTF!) or something else odd&#8230; i forget the rest now oO
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Oh yeah, and I remember now &#8230;. lots of parts before that&#8230;. For some reason I was carrying some sort of outdoor air conditioner compressor unit around&#8230;. while the fan was still blowing o_O &#8230;. and later it was starting to fall apart or what, and people were looking at me or smth &#8230;.
