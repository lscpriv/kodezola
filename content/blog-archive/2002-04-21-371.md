Okay, screw you IE and Opera&#8230; stupid test was Javascript with browser buttons, and both of those two misbehave on system double-clicks. IE makes the button move but doesnt count them into the script. Opera just doesnt move the button on the double-click, thus missing half of my clicks if they exceed the system double-click speed.

Mozilla gets it right ðŸ˜€

And an excessive 143 if I hover my arm over the mouse while holding it in place with my other hand, and sort of twitch my arm or smth. Yeah, cheating. On a really stupid test. Meh.
