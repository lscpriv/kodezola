And here's the promised photos of the rest of our Christmas fun.

<!-- more -->

We unwrapped the rest of our gifts yesterday, but I just got around to posting photos.

First there's my mom showing off a book my dad got her, and she's showing an almost sarcastic level of joy:

Then my dad showing off the set of walkie talkies that my mom got, which she thought would help out with their situation of having a hard time communicating across the house, or even across rooms, because my dad is hard of hearing:

And here are the blue sweat pants that I got, which should be great while it's still cold outside, until our requisite two weeks of cool weather per year has expired:

And my dad got my mom an insulated mug, similar but much larger than the insulated cup he got her for her birthday:

And this is one of the two ice cream maker bowls we got for each other this year. I was supposed to order three of them, but somehow only got two:

And this is the cat mug I picked out for my dad, a last minute choice from the Lang calendar store where we ordered our requisite dead tree wall calendars of the year:

And this was the sweat pants we got for my dad, in a different color, along with another Zoku ice cream maker bowl:

Bonus: Paying the pet tax, with some snaps of Abigale, one of our two cats, playing with the catnip toy pillows we bought them for Christmas. Another success story:

All in all, a great success, and a happy day.
