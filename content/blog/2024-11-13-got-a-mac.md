Woohoo, I finally got a new Mac! And boy, is it awesome. With some caveats, though.

<!-- more -->

It's an M4 Pro Mac mini, and I've been putting it through its paces. I did start to take some photos like I was going to do an unboxing, but the heck with it, I only managed to photograph the original shipping box, and the inner box sitting in the opened shipping box, which had a fancy fold out top and sides.

I've run some benchmarks, so I have them in my own account.

Geekbench 6.3.0 - [CPU](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8809944) - [Metal compute](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/compute/3121239)

And I did some iOS 3DMark runs: [Steel Nomad Light](https://f.losno.co/i/m43dmarksteelnomad.png) - [Solar Bay](https://f.losno.co/i/m43dmarksolarbay.png)

And for posterity, a *real* disk benchmark, as done with [AmorphousDiskMark](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amorphousdiskmark/id1168254295) and not any of those other screwy simplified things. Though I guess it's kind of okay that Blackmagic's benchmark does show relative comparisons of your basic sequential speed and media formats, but it doesn't really do a thorough job. No random test! Anyway: [AmorphousDiskMark result](https://f.losno.co/i/m4diskmark.png)

I'm having some trouble with the network dropping occasionally, but I'm hoping that Apple will have a solution for that in the short term, and not just tell me that I have a defective product. Maybe I shouldn't have sprung for the 10G networking for my 2.5G home.
