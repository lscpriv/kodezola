Welp, I've decided I've had enough of the Intel Arc Alchemist series. The drivers still aren't "quite" ready. Who knows when they will be. So I'm selling it and buying something from AMD instead.

<!-- more -->

So, after many months of putting up with so much crap from the drivers, and running experimental kernels on Linux, and booting Windows for firmware updates, I've decided it's time to exit. Maybe someone else will enjoy this card more than I did.

The experience on Linux was not so great, either. Random crashes on some games, rendering bugs, firmware issues... And an outlook on updates possibly taking months or more to finally settle down.

I'm planning to buy an AMD RX 6750 XT instead, for much more mature drivers, and a similar price point.
