I compiled detailed lists of my current two production machines on PCPartPicker, for the curious

<!-- more -->

I retired the list of my previous workstation, in the state it was in when I last used its configuration, here:

I have altered the list to the state the machine is currently in, functioning as a headless server machine, under its existing name. Laharl was short lived as a desktop machine, but will hopefully live long as a server and workhorse:

And finally, my new desktop, built just a few weeks ago, and completed over several rebuild sessions as new parts came in, finishing with the video card and new keyboard:

It is so-named "Copycat" because the configuration of the base components is almost identical to my boyfriend's new desktop. 7700X to his 7700, Peerless Assassin 120 SE to his AMD stock cooler, same RAM, same GPU, Black QUBE 500 to his White QUBE 500, same mouse. We both have mechanical keyboards, though different models. Thorough Copycat. Though I have a Seasonic 750W PSU that has lasted me since 2012 across multiple builds, while he just acquired a brand new 850W PSU. We both have a full set of four NVMe SSDs, too. Whew.
