Happy Christmas to all, or Festivus, or Hannukah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever holiday you happen to celibrate this season, if any. I unwrapped my first present, which was the only one which was technically to myself.

<!-- more -->

Yeah, you read that right. I bought myself a Black Friday pair of AirPods Max from Amazon, well in advance of all this striking and such, and got caught because they were still somewhat expensive, even if discounted significantly.

They're green. And unlike the pair I got early in this year and later returned, they're actually new and have a full warranty this time. But I was basically in not so many words asked to set them aside and they would become a Christmas present to me from my mom. I accepted those terms, since I technically did a bad thing buying expensive things, considering we're increasingly tightening funds.

Oh well, here we are. Some unpackaging photos for all:

Naturally, I've thought to keep all the original packaging this time around, in case who knows what happens, or in case they turn out as bad as the used pair I got before. Sure hope not.

There are actual thoughtful gifts prepared for all of us to share, but we'll open them in the daytime hours, and I'll document some of it in a later posting here. See you in the daytime, everyone.
