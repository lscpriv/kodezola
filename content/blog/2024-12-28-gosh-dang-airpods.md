The gosh dang AirPods Max have started their known tricks now. Maybe I made a mistake, but I'm sticking to my guns this time.

Yup, should'a listened to my last attempt, guess I'll give them regular breaks from now on. That's right, they get moist and occasionally hard reboot while in use.

Google says to factory reset them when this happens, but I doubt that has anything to do with it. They're getting moisture incursion and shorting out the contacts or buttons or something. Nothing can be done short of not using them for hours at a time and instead giving them regular breaks to dry out. Oh well, thanks all-aluminum design for condensing moisture like a champ.

I intend to keep using them, though, but now only for maybe an hour or two at a time, giving them 20-30 minute breaks to dry out without their protective case holding in moisture.

Somehow, I don't think the USB-C redesign fixed this problem, either. And best of all, they broke the analog connectivity by not offering a USB-C to ADC cable for them. And I don't feel like asking anyone who has some if they managed to find an ADC that works with them.
